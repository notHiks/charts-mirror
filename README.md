# OCI Helm Charts Mirror

This is our stop-gap mirror of OCI Helm Charts that can be used until maintainers of upstream charts publish them. See the issue [here](https://github.com/home-operations/charts-mirror/issues/8) for tracking the progress of upstream support for OCI charts added here.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Subscribe to the upstream issues or PRs tracking OCI support** because if you wish to use these charts understand it is **your responsiblity to make sure to change to the official OCI chart as soon as possible** as they will be deprecated here. I bare **no resposibility** for you **not paying close attention to this repository and the changes herein**. Once there is support upstream the OCI charts will remained published to this repo for 6 months, after which they will be pruned.

## Usage

### CLI

```sh
helm install ${RELEASE_NAME} --namespace ${NAMESPACE} oci://ghcr.io/home-operations/charts-mirror/${CHART_NAME} --version ${CHART_VERSION}
```

### Flux

> [!WARNING]
> Even though these charts are signed via cosign it will not prevent against malicious code being pushed from upstream ending up in a release here. For example if cert-managers Helm chart is compromised, there's nothing stopping that release from **NOT** being mirrored here.

## Contributing

1. Verify the chart doesn't already have an official OCI Helm Chart.
2. Create a new directory under `charts/` with the chart name.
3. Add a `metadata.yaml` to that new directory file with the contents and update the variables to reflect the chart you are adding:

    ```yaml
    ---
    registry: ${CHART_REGISTRY_URL}
    name: ${CHART_NAME}
    version: ${CHART_VERSION}
    ```

4. Open a PR with the link in the description to the upstream issue tracking OCI Helm Chart support.
